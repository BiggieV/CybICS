The hardware was kept simple and cost-efficient.
All you need is the CybICS baseboard, a Raspberry Pi 2 Zero and a 1602 display.
For the physical process visualization on the PCB a few LEDs are used.

The PCB can be ordered completly assembled at [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/).
The total cost for a testbed is around 50 euros.
However, the minimum purchase of PCBs is 5 pieces when ordered from [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/).
